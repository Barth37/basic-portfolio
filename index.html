        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="assets/images/IMG_9174.jpg" width="225" height="300">
        <p>I was born and raised in a very very small town in PA.  I went to school there from Kindergarten to grad school.  Upon graduation, I got a job at a bank, MBNA.  I worked there for several years before taking a job as a lon officer in Keybank's recreation lending division.  That division did lending for boats, yachts, and RV's.  Things I will never have so it was a nice glimpse into "how the other half live."</p>

        <p>I got married in '06 and soon followed our first child.  Once my wife's maternity leave ended, I decided that an early retirement was in order so I took the mantle of Mr. Mom.  10 years, I did this until my marriage sadly ended.  Back to work I go, but this time, it will be in something fun and interesting.  Coding it is!!</p>
