                <p>My name is Brian Arth and I am, more or less, a returning student.  I spent my work career in bank for 12 yrs before taking on the mantly of "Mr. Mom".  Not sure which of those was more difficult, but I can tell you which one smelled the worst.  My children are all in school so my workload has dramatically dropped so I decided that it was time to return to the work force.</p>
                <br>
                <p>As exciting as banking sounds, it wasn't.  I was in every area at some point or another; collections, customer service, risk, fraud, lending, etc.  Though they were interesting at times, it wasn't anything to build a career on.  So now that I have the time and resources, I decided that it was time to look into what I wanted to do and avoid the duldroms of "just any job".</p>
                <br>
                <p>Through much deliberation, I arrived at computers.  I am fairly competent using a computer, but I had no real idea how they do what they do.  I did a lot of reading and realized that coding was the answer.  So here I am.  Wish me luck!</p>
